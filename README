UDPSH - a concurrent udp server daemon and client shell

=== DESIGN ===

udpsh_util:
- a header for common C utilities and functions

udpsh_sock:
- a small library for handling common server and client udp functions
- common port for both client and server
- dns resolution
- ssl support
- sendto and recvfrom with error checking
- blocking by default to avoid common threading issues like synchronization
- provides a static socket send/receive buffer

udpsh_server:
- supports up to 4 concurrent sessions
- can be extended by increasing sessions array
- returns a sessionid to client for future communications
- upon disconnection, the session is made available for others to connect
- session threads are conditional, i.e they wont run unless there is new input from its client
- implements a basic global queue processing
- messages coming in are parsed and interpeted to execute their functions
- implements acks where every message from client receives an acknowlegment
- checks connected client address consistency between messages
- verbose in terms of how an error occured to clients
- simulate packet loss by scrambling buffer before sending to client

udpsh_client:
- connects to udpsh_server
- implements acks where every message to server waits for an acknowlegment
- interactive prompt. $ = connected, > = not connected
- ssl cert loading
- disconnects active session on quit
- help command

=== EXECUTION SEQUENCE ===

udpsh_server_main:
- wait for messages to be received
- clientack after any message
- store the sender info in a global udpsh_sock object
- if ssl function, accept then wait for ssl read then proceed
- tokenizes the messages received to function, sessionid and commandbuffer
- check if its connect, execute or disconnect and call appropriate function

connect:
- check is connected otherwise initiate a new one and wait for sessionid
- send ssl function and subsequent ssl write
- on server, look for unused sessions in array
- if found, spawn a thread, break loop and respond to client with sessionid
- on client, if sessionid valid, store it locally, otherwise wait for reason for error
- on server, send error to client is sessionid is invalid
- the session thread sets up condition variable and loops while session is valid
- its going to block until its condition variable is woken for a message send to its sessionsid

execute:
- if valid sessionid copy sender info to associated sessionid
- wake the session thread
- if still valid sessionid, tokenize commandbuffer into individual strings separated by spaces
- create a pipe and fork process
- on parent process, waitpid child
- on child process, dup2 stdout and stderr to pipe writing end such that writes to stdout and stderr will be sent to client
- on parent, when child finishes, read pipe end to its copy of global udpsh_sock buffer then close the pipe and free tokenized commandbuffer
- if enabled, simulate packet loss by scrambling the buffer
- send to client

disconnect:
- send disconnect message to client and invalidate session
- invalidation works by setting sessionid to invalid, waking thread, joining it then memset it to 0

=== NOT WORKING ===
- verifying address consistency between messages (implemented but not tested)
    - this is difficult to test since an address change often means an interface, iptables or packet header changes which makes
      the packets not to be sent

=== SSL CERTIFICATE AND KEY ===
- you can either:
    1: generate self signed cert and key 'pem' files (good for 10 years):
        openssl req -newkey rsa:4096 -x509 -sha256 -days 3650 -nodes -out mycert.pem -keyout mykey.pem
    2: use provided test cert.pem and key.pem (might be expired! and insecure)

=== RUNNING ===
- make
- ./udpsh_server [-pktloss PKTLOSS_IN_PERCENT] [-sslcert CERT -sslkey KEY]&
- ./udpsh_client
